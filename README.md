## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a cohesive and functional eight-page design, incorporating best practices in code readability, modularity, and responsive design. Each page is meticulously crafted to reflect the overall design vision while ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices, including desktops, laptops, and mobile phones.

## Key Features

### 1. Responsive Design for All Devices
- The design adapts well to different screen sizes, including desktop, laptop, and mobile.
- Thorough testing ensures the design looks good and functions properly on various devices.

### 2. Hover Effects
- Consistent and thoughtful hover effects enhance user experience.
- All hover effects are tested to work correctly across different elements and devices.

### 3. Mobile Layout: Card Design
- For mobile screens, content is organized within cards.
- Images are positioned at the top of the card, followed by the content below for improved readability and user experience.

### 4. Code Readability
- The code is clear and readable, making it easier to debug, understand, and update.
- Proper documentation ensures maintainability.

### 5. Modularity
- The codebase is structured into smaller, reusable components or functions.
- This modular approach simplifies code management, testing, and scaling as the project grows.

## Development Standards
- **Consistency in Design**: Ensuring design elements align with the visual and functional standards of the project.
- **Attention to Detail**: Typography, color schemes, spacing, and image placement are meticulously handled to match the intended design.
- **Best Practices**: Adhering to industry standards for code readability, modularity, and responsive design.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or relevant frameworks like React/Next.js).
- **Tools**: Responsive testing tools, browser developer tools, and version control (Git).
